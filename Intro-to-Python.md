## What is Python?

Python is a high-level, object-oriented programming language created by Guido van Rossum between 1989 and 1991.

It can be used for building web applications, data analysis, data visualisation and machine learning to name a few. It is used not only by Software Engineers but also Mathematicians and Data Analysts amongst others.

Python is popular as it can be used to solve complex problems but has a beginner friendly, easy-to-learn syntax. Due to this it has a large community as well as a substantial ecosystem of libraries, frameworks and tools. It's also open source, aka free.

## Who uses it?

Many of the biggest tech companies in the world reply heavily on Python as one of, or their main language.

Netflix for example, uses Python for its machine learning capabilities, to recommend films and tv that you may enjoy based on past preferences. Dropbox is another, which has used Python to scale rapidly, even hiring its creator Guido van Rossum to work with them for a while. Other notable users includes Google and Spotify. [Paypal](https://github.com/paypal/Checkout-Python-SDK) and [NASA](https://github.com/nasa/apod-api) also use Python, have a look at their APIs.

## Getting Started

_Python is dead. Long live Python!_

Your machine (looking at you Mac users) may have Python 2 already installed, however as of 1st January 2020, Python 2 is depreciated and no longer supported by the Python Software Foundation. 

⚠️ **We are going to be using Python 3.** ⚠️

Make sure you have this installed. Use `$ python --version` to make sure you have the latest release.

To get started we can simply type `$ python` (Mac) or `$ py` (Windows) into the command line to open up the Python interpreter. We can use this to run commands - try `print("Hello world")`.
