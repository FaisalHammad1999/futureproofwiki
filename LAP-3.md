In LAP 3 we bring everything together by looking at databases, both relational and non-relational. You'll learn to work with them, as well as connect them to apps by starting to build some APIs of your own. We'll also cover some important Computer Science concepts here by discussing Systems Architecture, Performance and Cybersecurity. By the end of this LAP you can really say you are a full-stack developer!
