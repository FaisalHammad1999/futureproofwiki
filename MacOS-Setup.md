*_We recommend using Docker containers during futureproof - and beyond!_* \

# Dev Environment Setup: MacOS
_Please note this is designed for MacOS Catalina. If you are on a previous version, you may need to refer to external materials if you come across any issues!_

## Essential: 
### Install Xcode Command Line Tools
In your terminal run: `xcode-select --install` 
If you hit any issues, download directly from [here](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/?=command%20line%20tools) (select the most recent stable version or the one stated for your OS version).
The installation can take a little time - at least 5 minutes. Grab yourself a tea.

### Connect git to GitHub
- Run: `git version` to see if you have git installed.
- You probably do but if not run: `brew install git` (see *Install Homebrew* below) or download directly [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/).
- To configure it to connect to your GitHub account run:\
  `git config --global user.email “your@emailadd.com”`\
  `git config --global user.name “yourGithubUsername”`

### Setup an SSH key (and add it to your GitHub account)
- Run: `ssh-keygen` and follow the instructions. If it asks if you want to overwrite, say no.
- Run: `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` and copy the output.
- Visit the [GitHub SSH keys settings page](https://github.com/settings/keys) in your browser and click ‘New SSH Key’
- Give it a title (anything you want to indicate the machine this key is for) and paste in your key.

### Test run GitHub!

### Setup Docker and VSCode Remote - Containers
Complete [this practice repo](https://github.com/getfutureproof/fp_study_notes_hello_docker) using the [accompanying walkthrough](https://github.com/getfutureproof/fp_guides_wiki/wiki/Setting-up-Containers-with-VS-Code)!

### Get node locally and install a global package
Although we will use Docker for many things, we will also install node locally for some global use tools that we may use.
- Download and install nodejs using the [official installers](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or Homebrew (see below)
- Confirm your node installation
    + In your terminal, run `node -v`
    + If you see a version number eg. `v12.19.0` then your install was successful!
    + You should also get version numbers back for `npm -v` and `npx -v`
- Install your first global node package
    + `npm install -g laughs`
    + `ha` - wait for a joke!

## Optional: 
### Install Zsh
- Run: `echo $SHELL` to see if you have Zsh installed. 
- If it does not output `/bin/zsh` run: `brew install zsh` (see *Install Homebrew* below) and `chsh -s /bin/zsh`
- Restart your terminal.

### Install Homebrew
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a popular package manager for Mac & Linux applications.
