The final LAP revolves around transferring what you have learned in the previous 3 to a new language, Python. We'll look at the differences in syntax and methods from JavaScript and introduce you to two new frameworks, Django and Flask. In this LAP we will also talk about Object Oriented Programming in more depth. The LAP will wrap up with an intro to Data Science so that you are familiar with the concepts.
