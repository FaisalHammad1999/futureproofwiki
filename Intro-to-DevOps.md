DevOps is a portmanteau (two words smushed together) of Development and Operations. Let's look at them in their traditional separate forms first.

### Development
This covers the actual writing of a new feature, app, website etc. Job titles in this field may include 'Web Developer', 'Software Developer', 'Front-end Developer', 'Software Engineer'

### Operations
This covers the needs of getting code out to release, database admin, QA testing and more. Job titles in this field may include 'Operations Engineer', 'QA Tester', 'System Administrator', 'Security Engineer'

## DevOps
DevOps is not easy to define as it is as much a mindset as anything else. The idea to bring these two departments together aims to bring a smoother end-to-end experience for all people involved, including the end user (usually without their knowledge). Having a DevOps approach should mean less miscommunication between departments, less duplication of work, more efficient processes, quicker release schedules and in the end, happier clients.

In a DevOps approach, all of the roles mentioned above would have more insight and access to the work of the other department. There is also an increasing demand for the role of 'DevOps Engineer' which really does bridge the gap. Increasingly we are expected to understand more and more about the entire cycle since we have more opportunity to communicate with people in roles we may not have previously had much time with.

## DevOps cycle
Whilst difficult to define, there is a generally accepted DevOps 'cycle':

#### Plan
As it sounds, before any code is written, a plan is made! This can involve many people with insight about various relevant parts. Some sort of overarching plan or roadmap is crafted.

#### Code/Create
Coding with DevOps in mind can also mean making use of some tools that will smooth out the process such as good code hygiene, bearing security issues in mind, TDD approach etc.

#### Build
This is the part where we actually take our pieces of code and put it together in a package. In a DevOps mindset, this might be an automated action so the dev team can spot build errors early.

#### Test/Verify
This testing stage is beyond the tests done in the Code stage. As part of Continuous Integration, we want to know that when put together, our product works as expected when anything new is added.

#### Release
We're nearly ready to start sharing our product! This stage is where we do final checks to make sure everything is ready to go. It all works, but what should a user have access to? Do we include all our new features in this release or not? We can check everything in a 'staging' build.

#### Deploy/Configure
Now it's ready to be deployed! This should be using the same environment as test > staging so no nasty surprises await. This is also when we make sure our deployment hosting is working and users can access our product.

#### Operate
Your product is now out in the world and in use - but we need to make sure we are on top of things. Gathering feedback from users, making sure our servers can handle any new influx of traffic and generally keeping things ticking over, handling any server outages. This is a 24/7 job.

#### Monitor
This stage is similar to a retrospective. Continuous monitoring of feedback and usage can help flag current and potential issues. At this stage, we start feeding back up to the planning and the project team can start thinking about the next new update / feature to be coded!
