# Dev Environment Setup: Windows

### Git & GitBash Setup
Install the [latest release of git](https://git-scm.com/). Keep the standard options (make sure Git Bash is included in your install).
When selecting the various options:
- your default editor: Visual Studio Code
- PATH environment: 'Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software'
- HTTPS transport backend: OpenSSL library
- line ending conversions: 'checkout as-is, commit Unix-style line endings'
- git pull: default
- credential helper: Git Credential Manager Core
- enable symbolic links: true
Others are up to you but the defaults are generally good.

Open GitBash and configure git: \
`git config --global user.name "your name"` eg. `git config --global user.name "getfutureproof"` \
`git config --global user.email "your email"` eg. `git config --global user.email "admin@getfutureproof.co.uk"` \

When working on different operating systems, our line endings may end up getting changed. We will unify our line ending to match Unix-style: \
`git config --global core.autocrlf input`

### Set up your SSH key
- run `ssh-keygen` and follow the instructions. If it asks if you want to overwrite, say no.
- Run `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` and copy the output
- Visit the [GitHub SSH Keys setting page](https://github.com/settings/keys) in your browser and click 'New SSH Key'
- Give it a title, anything you like to indicate the machine this key is for, and paste in your key
- The first time you clone and push you may see warning that a new RSA key is being added, this is normal!

***NB: If using the VS Code terminal, we recommend selecting Git Bash as your Default Shell:***
- Open a new terminal in VS Code (see the application top bar)
- From the dropdown that likely says 1. Powershell, choose 'Select Default Shell' and select Git Bash
- Close the terminal and open a new one - the dropdown should now say '1. bash'

### Get node locally and install a global package
Although we will use Docker for many things, we will also install node locally for some global use tools that we may use.
- **Download and install nodejs using the [official installers](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)**
    + When going through the install wizard, the standard options are all okay for our usage
    + Check the box to allow automatic installation of additional tools
    + Select 'yes' when asked if you want to let node make changes to your device
    + After the installation, lookout for the Powershell window prompting to install the additional tools and press any key to continue
    + Again, select 'yes' when asked if you want to let Powershell make changes to your device
    + Get a cup of tea, this part can take a few minutes as it installs a bunch of other good things!
    + Once the scripts have finished running, follow the prompt to hit ENTER and restart your machine
- **Confirm your node installation**
    + After restarting your machine, open GitBash and type `node -v`
    + If you see a version number eg. `v12.19.0` then your install was successful!
    + You should also get version numbers back for `npm -v` and `npx -v`
    + **If this does not work** try `winpty node -v`
    + **If winpty worked** then follow the instructions below to add an alias to a `.bashrc` file
- **Install your first global node package**
    + `npm install -g laughs`
    + `ha` - wait for a joke! 

### Get python locally and discover the Zen of Python
- **Download and install the latest python version using the [official installers](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**
    + Follow a similar flow as for Node above
- **Confirm your python installation**
    + After restarting your machine, open GitBash and type `python --version`
    + If you see a version number eg. `Python 3.9.1` then your install was successful!
    + You should also get a version number back for `python -m pip --version`
    + **If this does not work** try `winpty python --version`
    + **If winpty worked** then follow the instructions below to add an alias to a `.bashrc` file
- **Check out the 'Zen of Python'**
    + `python` - to enter a python shell (bye, bash!)
    + `import this` - this will show you the Zen of Python!
    + `exit()` - to get back to bash

## The .bashrc file
A `.bashrc` file is a configuration file for the bash shell - which you'll be using if running GitBash. The dot at the beginning means it is a hidden file!

**To access the file**
- In GitBash, run `cd ~` which will take you to your home directory
- Run `ls -lah` to see all the files (even hidden ones) in the directory
- Look for one called `.bashrc`
    + If it does not exist, create it with `touch .bashrc`
- Open it in a text editor of your choice

**To add an alias** \
If you find yourself typing something lengthy a lot, you can create an 'alias'. For example, if you have to run `winpty python` everytime you want to run a python shell, you might wish that you could just use `python`.

The anatomy of an alias definition is : `alias <what-i-want-to-use>='<the-actual-command>'`
- eg. `alias node='winpty node'` (genuinely useful)
- eg. `alias npm='winpty npm'` (genuinely useful)
- eg. `alias python='winpty python'` (genuinely useful)
- eg. `alias pip='winpty pip'` (genuinely useful)
- eg. `alias showstuff='ls'` (genuinely not useful)

After making changes, make sure you save the file and **reload** GitBash before trying out your shiny new aliases!
